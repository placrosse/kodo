.. _Build and Test Status: http://buildbot.steinwurf.dk
.. _API Specification: http://buildbot.steinwurf.dk/doxygen/kodo/

.. The library enables researchers to implement new codes and algorithms,
.. perform simulations, and benchmark the coding operations on any platform
.. where a C++ compiler is available. The library provides a multitude of
.. building blocks and parameters that can be combined to create custom codes.
.. To ensure ease of use, several codes are predefined and a high level API
.. is provided.
