News for Kodo
=============

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more
detailed list of every change, see the Git log.

Latest
------
* Minor: Added generic helpers for invoking the initialize(...) and
  construct(...) functions. We now use this in our factories which
  allows them to work even when codecs do not specify one or both of
  these functions.
* Major: Changed the partial_shallow_symbol_storage to become more
  independent of the underlying storage layers. In addition the layer
  is now more strict it as it only supports a single partial
  symbol. This means that the user now should select the number of
  symbols to match this requirement.
* Major: Renamed the partial_shallow_storage_layers to
  const_partial_shallow_storage_layers and added
  mutable_partial_shallow_storage_layers
* Major: Updated to sak version 11.x.y
* Major: Updated to fifi version 12.x.y
* Minor: Update to waf 1.8.0-pre1
* Minor: Made python files comply with pep8
* Major: Removed unused file ``test/src/kodo_unit_test/test_reuse.hpp``.
* Major: Restructured the design and use of factories. The factories
  are no longer defined as the last layer in a stack. The main
  motivation for this change was that it allows extension of existing
  stacks but also that it simplifies the structure of the stacks. The
  ability to extend a stack is convenient when applications need to
  add/embed additional state into an encoder or decoder. Using the
  previous design this could only be done by re-defining the stack
  and all its layers.
* Bug: Fixed proxy_stack ambiguous definition warnings with clang++

17.0.0
------
* Major: Added tracing functionality to most of the coding
  stacks. Enabling or disabling support for tracing is done via a
  compile time constant. When tracing is enabled it is possible to get
  human readable information about the encoding and decoding progress
  at run time. This replaces the debug layers functionality. An
  example can be found in the use_trace_layers example.
* Bug: Fixed bug in the proxy_remote_rank layer. The state was
  incorrectly updated causing the remote rank to be erroneous. This
  bug was reported by Jonas Hansen <jonas@hrjonashansen.dk>
* Major: Updated terminology in the proxy_layer and proxy_stack layers
  to more consistently use the terms main- and proxy-stack.
* Major: Started to use C++11 features only available in: gcc/g++-4.7
  and later and Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.
* Major: Update to Fifi version 11, which brings in hardware
  accelerated finite field computations (based on SIMD instructions).
* Minor: Added sliding window encoder and decoder. These codes extend
  the functionality of the on the fly codes which allow encoding
  before all symbols are available, by supporting feedback between the
  decoder and encoder such that already seen symbols are not included
  in the encoding again. See examples/sliding_window for an example.
* Minor: Added feedback convenience API which allows state to be
  communicated between codec stacks. As an example see the
  examples/sliding_window example which demonstrates the use of
  feedback. Generic functions are also available which allows compile
  time checks of whether a codec stack supports feedback.
* Major: Several optimizations to the systematic_encoder layer and
  related layers which allows finer control over which packets should
  be sent systematically and which should not.

16.2.0
------
* Minor: Reorganized the unit test files in the test folder so that
  all .hpp helper files are located in the test/src/kodo_unit_test
  subfolder. This makes it possible for derivative projects, libraries
  and applications defining their own encoding decoding stacks to
  utilize the unit test helpers from Kodo. The main Kodo wscript
  exports the test/src as an include so that projects may find the
  unit test helpers by using
  e.g. #include<kodo_unit_test/test_helper.hpp>

16.1.0
------
* Minor: Added an elimination decoder, this type of decoder can be
  used to "remove" unwanted symbols included in the encoding. It is
  the building block for e.g. layered decoders where only a subset of
  the layers are wanted.

16.0.0
------
* Major: Updating dependency to fifi version 10.x.y
* Bug: Fix kodo overhead parameter ``symbol erasure probability`` to
  ``erasure``.
* Bug: Fix support for fifi::binary16 in the Reed-Solomon codes.
* Minor: Adding the user_defined_generator layer, which allows users
  to specify the coding coefficients to be used directly.
* Major: Update the coefficient storage API. The previous naming
  scheme caused some confusion about the API, the new naming scheme
  hopefully makes the API easier to read and understand.
* Major: Updating dependency to gauge version 7.x.y
* Minor: Added tables dependency
* Major: Modified output from decoding probability benchmark. The rank
  is now printed as a 2D list.
* Major: Changed the benchmark option for the throughput benchmark
  from "throughput_average_nonzero_symbols" to
  "sparse_density_options", where the first specified the number
  (integer) of average nonzero symbols and the latter specify the
  ratio of nonzero symbols (float).
* Minor: Switched to using gauge::runner::add_default_printers() in
  kodo benchmarks this means most printers (the way results are saved)
  are enabled by default.

15.0.0
------
* Major: renamed method for specifying the average number of nonzero
  symbols in the sparse codes from set_nonzero_symbols to
  set_average_nonzero_symbols.
* Major: Added a new decoding symbol status API which allows the state
  of the decoding symbols to be tracked. A decoding symbol may be in
  three states "missing", "seen" and "decoded" checkout the
  symbol_decoding_status_tracker and symbol_decoding_status_counter
  layers. The bidirectional_linear_block_decoder now directly uses
  these layers instead of internally maintaining the information. So
  if you use the bidirectional_linear_block_decoder layer you need to
  specify at least the symbol_decoding_status_tracker layer in your
  stacks.
* Minor: Added new example which shows how to switch between
  systematic and unsystematic encoding. The example can be found in
  the examples/switch_systematic_on_off folder.
* Major: Users of the partial_decoding_tracker layer for on-the-fly
  decoding should now use the rank_symbol_decoding_status_updater
  layer to ensure that proper detection of early decoding happens
  correctly. The existing on-the-fly codes in the
  src/kodo/rlnc/on_the_fly_codes.hpp have been updated.
* Bug: Several unit tests are defining classes in the .cpp
  files. While this is typically not a problem, it can unexpectedly
  result in a violation of the ODR (One-Definition-Rule) resulting in
  undefined behavior of the resulting binary. To avoid this problem
  classes / structs defined in the .cpp files should be wrapped in an
  anonymous namespace.

14.0.0
------
* Bug: Fixed assert in the payload_rank_decoder.hpp which incorrectly
  checked for the received encoder rank to be less than the currently
  largest rank.  This is not the case for e.g. recoding or if packet
  reordering occurs.  Reported by Martin Hundebøll.
* Major: Fixed problem with is_partial_complete() and recoding. The
  problem was that the recoder would forward its own rank instead of
  the rank of the encoder. This could result in cases where a decoder
  would falsely report an early decoding opportunity since it detected
  that it had reached the rank of the encoder. This has been fixed by
  the payload_rank_recoder layer which now forwards the largest seen
  encoder rank instead of the rank of the recoder. We have also
  modified the API naming for reading the encoder rank, from
  "encoder_rank()" to "seen_encoder_rank()". This problem was reported
  by Martin Hundebøll.
* Major: Changed the get_density() function in
  sparse_uniform_generator to density().

13.0.0
------
* Major: Replaced the linear_block_decoder with the
  bidirectional_linear_block_decoder layer. The bidirectional linear
  block decoder layer uses a direction policy to determine whether to
  perform Gaussian elimination from left-to-right or
  right-to-left. Certain newer network coding algorithms can be
  implemented efficiently utilizing this flexibility. Based on the
  bidirectional layer we have added the forward and backwards linear
  block decoder.
* Minor: Added support for specifying the number of nonzero symbols in
  the sparse codes (this extends the API which previously only
  supported a fraction of nonzero symbols to be specified).
* Minor: Added generic functions for printing debug information from
  codec stacks where this functionality is supported.

12.0.0
------
* Major: Changed the partial_decoding_tracker to only provide the
  functionality needed to detect "early" or partial decoding. The
  monitor functionality has been moved to the
  largest_nonzero_index_decoder layer.
* Minor: Added the payload_rank_encoder and payload_rank_decoder
  layers which will explicitly exchange the rank of the encoder matrix
  and the decoder matrix to support partial decoding.

11.2.0
------
* Minor: Added the partial_decoding_tracker layer which "monitors" the
  coding vectors being passed to a decoder in order to detect early
  decoding opportunities. This means that although not all packets
  have yet been sent from the encoder, it might happen that we can
  decode anyway. This kind of functionality is useful especially for
  applications which require low delay.
* Minor: Added on-the-fly encoding and decoding stacks in
  src/kodo/rlnc/on_he_fly_codes.hpp the on-the-fly stacks have the
  advantage that they allow encoding and decoding to proceed even
  without having all encoding symbols available.

11.1.0
------
* Minor: Added new cached_symbol_decoder layer, this layer does not
  perform any decoding on the incoming symbol, but provides access to
  the encoded symbol's coefficients and data. An example
  use_cached_symbol_decoder was added to show a possible use case for
  this layer.
* Minor: Added new example showing some one way to use some of the
  debug layers in kodo. The example is in the examples folder called
  use_debug_layers
* Bug: Fix missing return in the payload_recoder recode() function.

11.0.0
------
* Minor: Added decoding probability benchmark. The benchmark measures
  the the number of symbols needed to decode from which the decoding
  probability can be derived.
* Major: Refactored the factory layers so that the layer::construct()
  and layer::initialize() functions are now template functions. The
  motivation for this is that it relaxes the layer ordering since all
  layers will now have access to the full factory type. I.e. layers
  lower in the stack can call functions on the factory defined higher
  in the stack. This was previously not possible.
* Minor: Moved the symbols and symbol_size related functions from the
  factory layers.
* Minor: Adding new overhead benchmark. The overhead benchmark
  profiles the total overhead in bytes transmitted on the wire for
  different code configurations.
* Minor: Added sparse_uniform_generator, which can we used to control
  the amount of non-zero vs zero elements generated in e.g. a RLNC
  encoding vector.
* Minor: Adding support for git protocol option in the wscript
* Bug: The uniform_generator and sparse_uniform_generators contained a
  bug which meant that not all symbols were considered for recoding,
  when rank of a recoder was not full.

10.0.0
------
* Bug: Fixed incorrectly failing assert in the
  linear_block_encoder. The assert was triggered during recoding when
  a storage for a specific symbol was not explicitly set by the
  layer::set_symbol() or layer::set_symbols() functions.  The bug was
  introduced in version 9.0.1, the unit test has been updated to
  correctly detect this issue in the future.
* Major: All codec stacks using the linear_block_encoder, should now
  add the storage_aware_encoder layer below the
  linear_block_encoder. This is to ensure that the encoder is reusable
  for RLNC recoding.
* Major: Re-factor symbol storage API to avoid confusion about which
  symbols has been explicitly specified by the user and which have
  not. This information is now available through the
  symbols_available(), symbols_initialized() family of functions.

9.0.1
-----
* Bug: Fix behavior of deep_symbol_storage::set_symbols() to set all
  symbols.
* Bug: When reusing decoders containing the linear_block_decoder layer
  systematic symbols where not correctly initialized. A fix was added
  to the linear_block_decoder and the unit test test_reuse_incomplete
  now checks for this issue.

9.0.0
-----
* Minor: Adding the shallow storage decoder which allows decoding
  objects larger than a single block or generation.
* Minor: Adding new example of an on-the-fly encoder. This example
  shows how to use an encoder before all symbols for that encoder has
  become available. This can be very useful in cases where data is
  produced on-the-fly, e.g. some form of streaming. The example can be
  found in the "examples/encode_on_the_fly" folder.
* Minor: Adding a deep storage decoder which provides the memory
  needed to decode a large object spanning several blocks.
* Minor: Adding simple decoding example. This example shows how to
  input symbols and coefficients directly into the decoder and how
  some of the debug layers can be applied to debug the decoding
  process.
* Bug: Made all factories non-copyable by making copy constructor and
  copy assignment constructor private.
* Bug: Fix issue in recoding_symbol_id, where sak::copy_storage
  triggered an assert when using an decoder with symbols less than
  max_symbols.
* Major: Changed construct() and initialize() functions of a coding
  layer to accept the factory as the only parameters. This breaks
  backwards compatibility with Kodo version 8.0.0.
* Major: Changed the factory build() function to accept no parameters.
  Factories are now configured e.g. using set_symbols(uint32_t) before
  calling build() to create a new encoder / decoder.
* Minor: Moved finite_field_counter layer from the benchmarks to the
  library source folder. This makes it possible to add it to any codec
  stack where the number of finite field operations should be monitored.
* Minor: Updated to waf-tools version 2.x.y
* Major: Updating dependency to gauge version 5.x.y

8.0.0
-----
* Updated layers to follow new API specifications. This change will
  break most existing layers. The API specification is available in
  the doxygen folder.
* New API for object/file encoders, makes it easier to support custom
  data sources e.g. such as memory mapped files.
* Added file encoder example.
* Replaced the old generator API with new Coefficient Generator API.
* Updated the factory APIs to pass the factory to each layer. This
  simplifies construction in several layers, where previously it was
  not possible to access the factory.
* Updated waf to 1.7.9 and enabled use of the wurf_install_path tool.

7.0.1
-----
* Fixed missing include in storage.hpp

7.0.0
-----
* Update waf to use external tools repository
* Updated waf to not use git local clones which are creating hardlinks
  that are not allowed on the "afs" filesystem

6.0.0
-----
* Bump fifi to version 6
* Bump sak to version 7

5.0.0
-----
* Bump fifi to version 5.x.y.
* Bump sak to version 6.x.y.

4.0.0
-----
* Using .hpp extension instead of .h

3.0.1
-----
* Removing asserts on symbol size. Fifi should handle symbol sizes not
  a multiple of 16.

3.0.0
-----
* Moved source files to the src folder
* Added operations counter benchmark
* Switched to use the cxx-gauge project for the benchmark code
* Bump fifi to version 3
* Bump boost to version 2
* Bump sak to version 4

2.0.1
-----
* Created linear_block_xyz codes as a building block for future and
  existing block code implementations.
* Refactored RLNC recoding functionality to utilize allow a larger
  re-use of existing code.
* Added initial version of encoding/decoding throughput benchmarks.
* Fixed Mac support in build scripts

2.0.0
-----
* Updated the Waf build system to handle dependencies better. The new
  tools used are not compatible with the old versions so we have to
  bump the major version.
