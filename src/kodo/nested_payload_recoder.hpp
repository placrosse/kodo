    /// @brief Implements the recode function for Network Codes.

    /// The nested_payload_recoder layer has been implemented as a
    /// simple layer forwarding calls to recode to a nested/proxy
    /// stack. The reason for this design was that recoding can be
    /// implemented by almost entirely copying the layers of an
    /// encoder. However, to avoid mixin encoding and decoding layers
    /// the encoding layers are typically place in a nested
    /// stack. This layer forwards the recode call to that stack.
