    /// @brief Complete stack implementing a shallow storage delayed RLNC
    ///        decoder.
    ///
    /// The decoder is identical to the full_rlnc_decoder except for
    /// the fact that is uses a shallow storage layer. Furthermore the
    /// decoder uses a delayed Gaussian elimination decoder.  Delayed
    /// here refers to the fact the we will not perform the backwards
    /// substitution until full rank is reached. This has the
    /// advantage that it should overall reduce the necessary number
    /// of finite field operations needed - this is obtained by
    /// reducing the so called fill-in effect. Fill-in refers to the
    /// fact that by performing row operations we may change an
    /// element previously zero into a non-zero element. Fill-in is
    /// also most often an effect seen with sparse codes.
